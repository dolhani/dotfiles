# Lucy's Dotfiles

My dotfiles are near complete and much satisfactory, thanks to the myriad developers out there who opened up their codes!

## Features

### Bash
- Though tempted by [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/) from time to time, I'm quite content with my current [bash](http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/bash.html) settings. If I'm bored one day, I might migrate.
- [z](https://github.com/rupa/z) is a small shell scipt that should be nominated for the Nobel prize or something. (It lets you jump around directories based on your log 'frecencies'.)
- I maintain a `.bash_aliases`(which contains more than aliases) and `.bash_functions`.

### Vim
- I've forked Amir Salihefendic's [basic .vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/basic.vim) and customized it (e.g., add code templates).
- `.vim` plugins are managed with [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen). ([kien](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) should be another Nobel Laureate for `ctrlp`. Lets you jump around files in Vim.) 
- I use 'xterm16' as the base colorscheme and I like it.
- Skeleton files for C, HTML, Java, Python sometimes make my life easier (but sometimes not).

### Tmux
- My `.tmux.conf` is based on [Florian Crouzat's](http://files.floriancrouzat.net/dotfiles/.tmux.conf), where I've commented out stuff and added pane selection key bindings.

### Git
- [scm_breeze](https://github.com/ndbroadbent/scm_breeze) is a MUST-GET for git! (I guess you can `submodule` it. Though I didn't, yet.)

### irssi
- I'm often on IRC (any interesting channels?), and use [irssi](http://www.irssi.org/download) as the client.
- I quite happy with my config, thanks to [Matt](http://quadpoint.org/articles/irssi/) for letting me know the existence of `awl`, and [Anton](http://www.antonfagerberg.com/archive/my-perfect-irssi-setup) who introduced `xchatnickcolor.pl`.

### ssh
- Uploading an `.ssh/config` file on the web may not be the smartest thing to doâ€¦ but.
